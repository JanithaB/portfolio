# My First Commit

Hello there, welcome to my humble corner of the internet.

I didn’t start this as a blog.

This was supposed to be just a portfolio site, a place to showcase what I’ve built.  
But somewhere along the way, I felt the urge to write about the things I keep running into while working in this field.

Not because I had something groundbreaking to announce,  
but because I wanted a clean place to be honest.

I’ve been building things with code for a while now.  
Real things, systems that talk to hardware, backends that move data, dashboards, gateways, scripts that quietly keep everything from falling apart.

At this point, you’ll probably realise some of the above sounds very… AI-written 😅  
and you are correct. Some of it are.

I said I’m going to be honest here.  
So, no filters from now on.

I don’t carry a big title.  
I’m not here to act like an expert.  
And I’m definitely still learning, every single day.

So this is my first commit.

## Why Development?

I started by writing small scripts, experimenting, making things do *something* useful.

From firmware on ESP32s to backend services, from moving data around to deploying AI agents, it’s been a surprisingly intense journey so far. Enough that I felt it was worth logging somewhere.

A lot of it came from:

- trying to make things work  
- connecting pieces that weren’t meant to talk to each other  
- staring at logs, configs, and bugs that made no sense. Until they did.

I’ve worked on systems where:

- hardware meets software  
- reliability actually matters  
- small mistakes cause very real problems  

Somewhere in the middle of all that complexity, I realised something important:

You *have* to get yourself bloody and messy before things start making sense.

I like understanding how things work, not just using them.  
How systems are built.  
How the wheels keep spinning in our day to day lives.

That curiosity is what pulled me deeper into development.

## Why a Blog?

This isn’t a “dev influencer” blog or a newsletter full of guidelines.

It’s here to document the process.

I want a place where I can:

- write through what I’m learning (Backend, IoT, AI)  
- break down concepts until *I* actually understand them  
- get community feedback and grow from it  
- log things that felt important at the time I was building them  
- look back one day and clearly see progress  

If someone else finds comfort or clarity in these posts, that’s a bonus.

## What You Can Expect Here

This blog will probably include:

- things I’m building and breaking  
- lessons from real projects  
- explanations written the way I wish I’d read them  
- occasional frustration when something absolutely refuses to work  

Nothing overly polished.  
Nothing exaggerated.

Just honest progress.

## Final Thoughts

This isn’t a perfect beginning.

But it’s an accurate one.

And I think that matters more.
